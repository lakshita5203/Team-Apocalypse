Hackathon project submitted by team - APOCALYPSE
## Problem Statement 
One day enjoying at DC in New Delhi , our eyes get caught in a situation of heavy traffic jam as a results various vehicles clashed into each other. Looking forward 
into this , what we observed that the same happens in every walking and busy road.But a thing that took our attraction are parked cars and other vehicles , these vehicles 
are parked unevenly in the corner spaces and formed a lane which for sure reduces the area for other driving vehicles.And the major reason behind all these uneven parking 
of vehicles is that most of them don't know the empty areas(not in use for any purpose) near a specified suffered location which can be used as parking. Making out form 
this,we team APOCaLYPSE wants to find a way to avoid these road accidents and time spent by the meek drivers in finding the right parking spot.
## Solution 
â€¢	The problem of road accidents is mainly due to traffic jams caused by uneven parking on the main roads. Moreover, finding the right parking spots available near the drivers is time consuming .
This can be sort out with the effective system of well organised parking . In short , increasing the effectiveness of parking system and efficiency of drivers with the same will surely can be proven as one of the budding solution in the transportation track.

We made a responsive web app for :

1. Taking the location of user as one of the input.
2. Finding the empty space which is further divided into 2 phases.
   - 1st phase - For the drivers to login/signup by providing the respective name , car number and phone no.
   - 2nd phase - For the people who can add the locations which can be used as parking spots.
3. Concluding the nearest empty spaces which can be used as parking spots.

This will reduce the congestion of cars parked on the roads which are particularly not allowed for the same. (violation of traffic rules is usual today)
## Features and Benifits 
### Features 
1. This is a user friendly web app.
2. Access of nearby government parkings.
3. Range is increased automatically if parking is not found in instant accessed location of user.
4. Making a balance by including the payment mode for the owned empty spaces by someone.
5. Reserving those parking spaces also ,which are once added by a user , as taking most precise approximation will be more accurate if the known parking spots will also be included.

### Benifits
1. Helps in reducing the time taken to park the vehicle as all people/drivers are not familiar with all the places .
2. Helps in improving the view of parking system in our country (both efficiently and effectively).
3. Also useful in preventing the traffic jams caused by illegal parking of cars mainly on running roads.
4. Provides an well organised parking facility as those in foreign countries.
